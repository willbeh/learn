## üèÜ Completion Guidelines

### For Each Challenge:
- [ ] Read the entire challenge description
- [ ] Understand the learning objectives
- [ ] Complete all TODO items
- [ ] Test your implementation thoroughly
- [ ] Try the bonus challenges
- [ ] Review the solution for alternative approaches

### For Each Level:
- [ ] Complete all challenges in order
- [ ] Understand the concepts before moving on
- [ ] Experiment with variations and improvements
- [ ] Apply learned concepts to personal projects

## üí° Tips for Success

### 1. **Read Carefully**
Each challenge includes detailed comments explaining what you need to implement. Take time to understand the requirements before coding.

### 2. **Start Small**
Begin with the simplest TODO items and build up complexity gradually. Don't try to implement everything at once.

### 3. **Test Frequently**
Run your code often to catch errors early. Use `console.log()` liberally to understand what your code is doing.

### 4. **Experiment**
Don't just complete the minimum requirements. Try different approaches, add features, and make the challenges your own.

### 5. **Learn from Solutions**
After completing a challenge, study the provided solution. There are often multiple ways to solve the same problem.

### 6. **Practice Regularly**
Consistent practice is key to mastering programming. Try to work on challenges regularly rather than in long, infrequent sessions.
