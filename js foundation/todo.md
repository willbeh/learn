# JavaScript Challenges Project Todo

## Phase 1: Analyze presentation content and plan challenges ✓
- [x] Extract content from PowerPoint presentation
- [x] Identify key JavaScript topics covered
- [x] Plan challenge structure and difficulty levels

## Phase 2: Create beginner-level JavaScript practice files ✓
- [x] Variables and data types exercises
- [x] Basic arithmetic operations
- [x] String manipulation challenges
- [x] Simple conditional statements
- [x] Basic loops practice

## Phase 3: Create intermediate JavaScript challenges ✓
- [x] Complex conditional logic puzzles
- [x] Loop-based algorithms
- [x] Function definition and usage
- [x] Array manipulation with for...in loops
- [x] Error handling with try/catch

## Phase 4: Create advanced JavaScript challenges with modern features ✓
- [x] Template literals and string interpolation
- [x] Destructuring assignments
- [x] Spread syntax applications
- [x] let/const vs var scoping challenges
- [x] Advanced function concepts

## Phase 5: Create solution files and documentation ✓
- [x] Complete solution files for all challenges
- [x] Detailed explanations and comments
- [x] README with instructions
- [x] Difficulty progression guide

## Phase 6: Package and deliver the challenge files to user ✓
- [x] Organize files in logical structure
- [x] Create final package
- [x] Deliver to user with attachments

## Topics to Cover (from presentation):
- Variables (let, var, const)
- Operators (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical)
- String handling and template literals
- Conditional statements (if/else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while, for...in)
- Functions (parameters, return values, scoping)
- Modern ES6+ features (destructuring, spread syntax)
- Error handling (try/catch/finally)
